# Project: INFRAFORM Agent ‚Äî AI Motion Assistant for High-Fashion Visuals

**Submitted for AI Week NYC 2025**

INFRAFORM Agent is an experimental AI workflow that blends autonomous prompt logic with fashion-driven motion design. The goal is to create a semi-intelligent assistant that helps generate surreal, editorial runway scenes with structured garments, atmospheric tension, and cinematic lighting.

### üîç What It Does

This project explores:
- A **dynamic prompt engine** for generating consistent runway motion across multiple AI tools (Kling, OpenArt, Firefly)
- **Pose-aware motion logic**: seated, turning, walking, sidestep ‚Äî with runway confidence
- **Fabric and light control prompts** for feather burnouts, organza, glistening surfaces
- Reusable motion slates for multi-look sequences

### üí° Use Case

The INFRAFORM Agent is built for digital designers, stylists, and CGI fashion artists who want to rapidly ideate and generate high-concept visuals ‚Äî without relying on static AI renders or stylized over-exaggeration.

**Core inspiration**: 1970s sculptural tailoring √ó futuristic textile overlays √ó AI-driven movement.

# Project: The House Is Thinking ‚Äî Agentic Prompt System for Psychological Horror Sequences

**Submitted for AI Week NYC 2025**

_‚ÄúThe house isn‚Äôt haunted ‚Äî it‚Äôs observing.‚Äù_

**The House Is Thinking** is a visual AI experiment that uses agentic prompt logic to generate psychological horror tableaus. The system automates complex visual sequences: haunted hallways, breathing walls, ceiling creatures, blood-soaked furniture, and architectural decay ‚Äî all through chained prompt states.

### üëª Agentic Features

- **Emotion-state prompt trees**: fear, pressure, nausea, silence, anticipation
- **Environment-aware logic**: "add shadows on crown molding if pressure = high"
- **Creature consistency prompts**: bone nests, porcelain dolls, spine-twisting forms
- **Motion slate tool** for Kling/OpenArt AI motion clip tagging

### üî¨ Built With

- OpenArt AI (for creature and architecture generation)
- Kling AI (for motion, body tension, breath simulation)
- Custom JSON prompt trees
- Slate Generator: `/tools/slate_generator.py`

This agent was built to simulate how a haunted structure might "respond" to presence ‚Äî not with jump scares, but with intelligent, atmospheric dread.
